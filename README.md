# LCR

## Installation

Make sure that you have GHC and Stack installed. You can find installation instructions [here](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)

To run the program locally, use the following commands:

```
>>> stack build

>>> stack exec LCR-exe
```

TODO: the above instruction may or not work, in the meantime if you want the app to work you have to go to

```
>>> cd LCR/.stack-work/dist/(your-architecture)/ghc-9.6.3/build/LCR-exe
```
