## Installation

Make sure that you have GHC and Stack installed. You can find installation instructions [here](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)

To get a game_log out, run 

```
>>> stack run
```
This will save a `game_log.json` to the right place in the typescript files.

Afterward, making sure you have `npm` installed, run the app locally after you `cd my-game-ui` via
```
>>> npm start
```
WIP: enjoy!  Let's collab!
